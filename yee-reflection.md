#**Reflect**
## What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I think I was mainly struggling with pushing and pulling from Github

##What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Pushing files and Pulling were cleared up.  I think that the GPS session definitely helped me get a better grasp of git.

##What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
N/A for a pair
Asked Jamie guiding questions to help me through git.  I think git was confusing to begin with, but now seems a lot clearer.


##What still confuses you about Git?
Merge and fetch are still concepts that confuse me a bit. Not the concept, but mainly when you use it.


##How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I really enjoyed my first experience, despite being solo.  I think the GPS sessions help to clear up a lot of the questions that I had while doing the assignment solo.
